# Restaurant project

In this project, I have made a website for a restaurant where you can book yourself a table

## Booking a table
The main feature of this website is the abiility to see how many spaces are still available for any given time window

## Menu
On this website, the manu is pulled straight from a postgres database. So you can update the database with new menu items and it will automatically update the menu on the website.

## new item
